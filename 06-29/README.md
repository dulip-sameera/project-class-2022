## Developing OOP Project

This is the conversion of the previously built employee management project using procedural methods to OOP concepts

The Architecture of the project will be a modified MVC

Here
M - Model
V - View
C - Controller
D - Dao Classes

Here
View Classes are used to interact with the users of the program.

Controller classes are used to handle user requests and most of the logics in the program will be there.

Model classes will be used to wrap the data into single object which will help to handle data easy.

DAO classes are used to interact with the database.
